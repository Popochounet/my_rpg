[EPITECH] my_rpg

## WHAT IS IT ?

my_rpg is a project done in 4 weeks, in a group of 4 !\
In this project, we were asked to make a video game based on RPG mechanics (levels, npcs, quests, fights, ...).\
So we made a protest simulator üëç\
We could have done so much more with more time, but atleast we managed to make a complete game.

## HOW TO RUN

Clone the repository, and then run the ```./my_rpg``` binary at the root of the repo.\
If you can't find it, run ```make re``` at the root of the repo.

## HOW TO PLAY

On the main menu:
Click on **PLANIFICATION** to go to settings.\
Click on **ABANDONNER LA LUTTE** to quit.\
Click on **REPRENDRE VOS EXPLOITS** to continue a saved game.\
Click on **MANIFESTER** to play the game.

You will then have to choose a character, each one has differents stats and lore (for example, the *Cheminot* is the fastest character, and the *Doctor* heals the enemies).\
Doucle click to select.

Then, there is a small tutorial. Here are additionnal infos:\
You have to gather 30 protesters to invoke the final Boss, and win the game.\
You can level up your stats in the up-left corner of the UI.\
You can scroll to change your weapon.\
Policemen will try to stop you, but also try to discourage other protestors. Repel them with your selected weapons, clicking.\
Discouraged protestors will move to the left, you can't gather them.\
You can gather protestors moving to the right by "picking them up".\
Gather doctors to heal yourself.

If you press the esc key button, you will pause the game.\
In the pause sreen, you can:\
Save and Load (it will restart the protest, but you will keep your levels and stats).\
Go back to the menu.\
Quit the game.\
Go to settings.\
Resume the game.\
Go to the player management screen.

In the player management screen, you can:\
Change your weapon, and see its stats.\
Change your stats.\
See the main quest.
